241105: I am running into problems with data-limits since the program resends the whole conversation in a payload request, eventually hitting the limit. 
        Suggestions are to either have a conversation window, only remembering 10-20 latest messages OR use a conversation ID to retrieve conversation history.
        Idea: make an option to use either moving history window OR conversation ID.

        Update: the pruning seems to be working ok with a limit of 250 (whatever that means...)
        I should implement some history log where it also saves the pruned parts of the conversations...

241107: Make a class AIChatAgent that the conversation manager uses.

241121: I'd like to make a frontend for the AI-chat. I'll see if I can make a React frontend and use the current Python code as backend somehow...

Future Plans: 
        - Intergrate AI agents and tools (using LLamaIndex, Llamaparse?)
